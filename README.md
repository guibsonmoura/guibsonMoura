-Hi, I’m Guibson Meirelles Moura, I'm currently studying Software Engineering, Internet Informatics and doing a capitation in networks. In addition to academic life, I also work as a programmer at a systems company called Sicaf Sistemas
- I’m always interested in learning more technologies, solving difficult bugs is a satisfaction for me and besides work, programming is a hobby that I don't intend to give up anytime soon.
- I’m currently learning more about python, which is a language I've mastered, besides python I use other technologies like html, css, javascript, ajax, php e mysql. I also intend to learn java soon as it is a very powerful language and very active in the market
- I'm not currently trying to collaborate on any project as I still consider myself a junior programmer. So I'm just focused on creating projects, so that programming is like riding a bike...
